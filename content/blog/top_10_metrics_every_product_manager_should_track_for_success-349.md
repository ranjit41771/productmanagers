# Top 10 Metrics Every Product Manager Should Track for Success

In the fast-paced world of product management, understanding and tracking the right metrics can be the difference between a product's success and its failure. Metrics provide a clear, data-driven window into how a product is performing, helping product managers make informed decisions. However, with countless metrics available, it can be overwhelming to decide which ones are most valuable.

In this blog post, we'll explore the top 10 metrics every product manager should track to ensure their product is on the path to success. We'll delve into why each metric matters and how it can be effectively utilized.

## 1. **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**

### What is CAC?
Customer Acquisition Cost is the total cost of acquiring a new customer, including expenses related to marketing, sales, and any other promotional activities.

### What is CLV?
Customer Lifetime Value estimates the total revenue a customer is expected to generate during their relationship with a business.

### Why Track CLV?

### How to Improve NPS?
- Address customer complaints promptly.
- Enhance the customer experience by optimizing service delivery.
