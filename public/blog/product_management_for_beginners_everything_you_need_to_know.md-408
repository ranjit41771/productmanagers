Whether you're aspiring to break into product management or are curious about what the role entails, this guide is designed to provide a comprehensive overview of product management, including its responsibilities, skills required, and tools that can aid in the journey.

## What is Product Management?

Product management is the strategic function within an organization that deals with the planning, forecasting, production, and marketing of a product throughout its lifecycle. Product managers (PMs) are responsible for guiding the success of a product and leading the cross-functional team responsible for improving it.

The role of a product manager can vary significantly depending on the industry and company, but the core responsibilities often include understanding customer needs, setting the product vision, and working with engineering, marketing, and sales teams to bring the product to life.
