However, managing and leading these teams requires a strategic approach that balances creativity with structured planning. In this blog post, we'll explore effective strategies and tips for managing and leading product teams to achieve stellar results.

## Understanding the Role of Product Teams

Before diving into management strategies, it's essential to understand the core responsibilities of a product team. These teams are responsible for:
